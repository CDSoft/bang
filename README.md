Bang
====

Bang is a [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) file generator scriptable in [LuaX](https://cdelord.fr/luax).

Compilation
===========

Bang is written in LuaX.
It can be compiled with [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) and [LuaX](https://github.com/CDSoft/luax).

## LuaX

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CDSoft/luax
$ cd luax
$ make install  # this should install LuaX to ~/.local/bin
```

## Bang

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CDSoft/bang
$ cd bang
$ ./install.sh  # this should compile bang with Ninja and install it to ~/.local/bin
```

Usage
=====

```
$ bang -h
Usage: bang [-h] [-v] [-q] [-o output] [<input>]

Ninja file generator

Arguments after "--" are given to the input script

Arguments:
   input                 Lua script (default: build.lua)

Options:
   -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
   -v                    Print Bang version
   -q                    Quiet mode (no output on stdout)
   -o output             Output file (default: build.ninja)

For more information, see https://github.com/CDSoft/bang
```

* `bang` reads `build.lua` and produces `build.ninja`.
* `bang input.lua -o output.ninja` reads `input.lua` and produces `output.ninja`.

## Comments

`bang` can add comments to the Ninja file:

``` lua
comment "This is a comment added to the Ninja file"
```

`section` adds comments separated by horizontal lines:

``` lua
section [[
A large title
that can run on several lines
]]
```

## Variables

`var` adds a new variable definition:

``` lua
var "varname" "string value"
var "varname" (number)
var "varname" {"word_1", "word_2", ...} -- will produce `varname = word_1 word_2 ...`
```

The global variable `vars` is a table containing a copy of all the Ninja variables defined by the `var` function.

## Rules

`rule` adds a new rule definition:

``` lua
rule "rule_name" {
    description = "...",
    command = "...",
    ...
}
```

Variable values can be strings or lists of strings.
Lists of strings are flattened and concatenated (separated with spaces).

## Build statements

`build` adds a new build statement:

``` lua
build "outputs" "inputs"
```

generates the build statement `build outputs: inputs`.
The first word of `inputs` shall be the rule name applied by the build statement.

The build statement can be added some variable definitions in the `inputs` table:

``` lua
build "outputs" { "inputs",
    varname = "value",
    ...
}
```

There are reserved variable names for bang to specify implicit inputs and outputs and dependency orders:

``` lua
build "outputs" { "inputs",
    implicit_out = "implicit outputs",
    implicit_in = "implicit inputs",
    order_only_deps = "order-only dependencies",
    ...
}
```

## Default targets

`default` adds targets to the default target:

``` lua
default "target1"
default {"target2", "target3"}
```

## Phony targets

`phony` is a shortcut to `build` that uses the `phony` rule:

``` lua
phony "all" {"target1", "target2"}
-- same as
build "all" {"phony", "target1", "target2"}
```

## File listing

The `ls` function lists files in a directory.
It returns a list of filenames,
with the metatable of [LuaX F lists](https://github.com/CDSoft/luax/blob/master/doc/F.md).

- `ls "path"`: list of file names in `path`
- `ls "path/*.c"`: list of file names matching the "`*.c`" pattern in `path`
- `ls "path/**"`: recursive list of file names in `path`
- `ls "path/**.c"`: recursive list of file names matching the "`*.c`" pattern in `path`

E.g.:

``` lua
ls "doc/*.md"
: foreach(function(doc)
    build (fs.splitext(doc)..".pdf") { "md_to_pdf", doc }
end)
-- where md_to_pdf is a rule to convert Markdown file to PDF
```

## Dynamic file creation

The `file` function creates new files.
It returns an object with a `write` method to add text to a file.
The file is actually written when bang exits successfully.

``` lua
f = file "name" : write("content")
```

The file can be generated incrementally by calling `write` several times:

``` lua
f = file "name"
...
f:write "Line 1"
...
f:write "Line 2"
...
```

Examples
========

The Ninja file of bang ([`build.ninja`](build.ninja)) is generated by `bang` from [`build.lua`](build.lua).

The [`example`](example) directory contains a larger example:

- source files discovering
- multi-target compilation
- multiple libraries
- multiple executables
