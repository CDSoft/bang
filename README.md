Installation
============

Bang is written in LuaX.
It can be compiled with [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) and [LuaX](https://github.com/CDSoft/luax).

## LuaX

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CDSoft/luax
$ cd luax
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ninja install  # install LuaX to ~/.local/bin
```

## Bang

``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/CDSoft/bang
$ cd bang
$ ./boot.lua
$ ninja install  # build bang with Ninja and install it to ~/.local/bin
```

or set `$PREFIX` to install `bang` to a custom directory (`$PREFIX/bin`):

``` sh
$ PREFIX=/path ninja install # install bang to /path/bin
```

> [!WARNING]
> On Windows, `%PREFIX%` **must** be defined as there is no default installation path.

## Pure Lua implementation

Bang also comes with a pure Lua implementation for environments where LuaX can not be executed.
In this case `$PREFIX/bin/bang.lua` can be executed with any standard Lua 5.4 interpreter.

> [!NOTE]
> `bang.lua` may be slower than `bang`,
> especially when dealing with a large amount of source files.

Usage
=====

```
$ bang -h
Usage: bang [-h] [-v] [-q] [-g cmd] [-b builddir] [-o output]
       [<input>]

Ninja file generator

Arguments after "--" are given to the input script

Arguments:
   input                 Lua script (default: build.lua)

Options:
   -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
   -v                    Print Bang version
   -q                    Quiet mode (no output on stdout)
   -g cmd                Set a custom command for the generator rule
   -b builddir           Build directory (builddir variable)
   -o output             Output file (default: build.ninja)

For more information, see https://github.com/CDSoft/bang
```

* `bang` reads `build.lua` and produces `build.ninja`.
* `bang input.lua -o output.ninja` reads `input.lua` and produces `output.ninja`.

## Ninja functions

### Comments

`bang` can add comments to the Ninja file:

``` lua
comment "This is a comment added to the Ninja file"
```

`section` adds comments separated by horizontal lines:

``` lua
section [[
A large title
that can run on several lines
]]
```

### Variables

`var` adds a new variable definition:

``` lua
var "varname" "string value"
var "varname" (number)
var "varname" {"word_1", "word_2", ...} -- will produce `varname = word_1 word_2 ...`
```

`var` returns the name of the variable (prefixed with `"$"`).

The global variable `vars` is a table containing a copy of all the Ninja variables defined by the `var` function.
`vars` has a function `vars.expand` that takes a string and expands all Ninja variables (i.e. prefixed with `"$"`).

``` lua
var "foo" "xyz"
...
vars.foo    -- "xyz"
vars["foo"] -- same as vars.foo
vars.expand "$foo/bar" -- "xyz/bar"
```

> [!NOTE]
> the special variable `builddir` can be redefined by the `-b` option.
> Its default value is `".build"`.

### Ninja required version

The special variable `ninja_required_version` shall be set by the `ninja_required_version` function.
`ninja_required_version` will change the default required version only if the script requires a higher version.

``` lua
ninja_required_version "1.42"
```

### Rules

`rule` adds a new rule definition:

``` lua
rule "rule_name" {
    description = "...",
    command = "...",
    -- ...
}
```

Variable values can be strings or lists of strings.
Lists of strings are flattened and concatenated (separated with spaces).

Rules can defined variables (see [Rule variables](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html#ref_rule)).

Bang allows some build statement variables to be defined at the rule level:

- `implicit_in`: list of implicit inputs common to all build statements
- `implicit_out`: list of implicit outputs common to all build statements
- `order_only_deps`: list of order-only dependencies common to all build statements

These variables are added at the beginning of the corresponding variables
in the build statements that use this rule.

The `rule` function returns the name of the rule (`"rule_name"`).

### Build statements

`build` adds a new build statement:

``` lua
build "outputs" { "rule_name", "inputs" }
```

generates the build statement `build outputs: rule_name inputs`.
The first word of the input list (`rule_name`) shall be the rule name applied by the build statement.

The build statement can be added some variable definitions in the `inputs` table:

``` lua
build "outputs" { "rule_name", "inputs",
    varname = "value",
    -- ...
}
```

There are reserved variable names for bang to specify
implicit inputs and outputs, dependency orders and validation statements:

``` lua
build "outputs" { "rule_name", "inputs",
    implicit_out = "implicit outputs",
    implicit_in = "implicit inputs",
    order_only_deps = "order-only dependencies",
    validations = "build statements used as validations",
    -- ...
}
```

The `build` function returns the outputs (`"outputs"`),
as a string if `outputs` contains a single output
or a list of string otherwise.

The `build.files` function returns the current list of outputs of all previous `build` calls:

- `build.files()`: list of all output files
- `build.files(dir)`: list of all output files written in the directory `dir`
- `build.files(predicate)`: list of all output files that match the predicate `predicate`
  (`predicate` takes two arguments: the name of the file and the name of the rule that generates the file)

### Rules embedded in build statements

Some rules are specific to a single output and are used once.
This leads to write pairs of rules and build statements.

Bang can merge rules and build statements into a single build statement
containing the definition of the associated rule.

A build statement with a `command` variable is split into two parts:

1. a rule with all rule variables found in the build statement definition
2. a build statement with the remaining variables

In this case, the build statement definition does not contain any rule name.

E.g.:

``` lua
build "output" { "inputs",
    command = "...",
}
```

is internally translated into:

``` lua
rule "output" {
    command = "...",
}

build "output" { "output", "inputs" }
```

> [!NOTE]
> the rule name is the output name where special characters are replaced with underscores.

### Pools

`pool` adds a pool definition:

``` lua
pool "name" {
    depth = pool_depth
}
```

The `pool` function returns the name of the pool (`"pool_name"`).

### Default targets

`default` adds targets to the default target:

``` lua
default "target1"
default {"target2", "target3"}
```

> [!NOTE]
> if no custom target is defined and if there are help, install or clean targets,
> bang will generate an explicit default target with all targets, except from help, install and clean targets.

### Phony targets

`phony` is a shortcut to `build` that uses the `phony` rule:

``` lua
phony "all" {"target1", "target2"}
-- same as
build "all" {"phony", "target1", "target2"}
```

## Bang variables

### Bang arguments

The command line arguments of bang are stored in a global table named `bang`.
This table contains:

- `bang.input`: name of the Lua input script
- `bang.output`: name of the output Ninja file

### Build script arguments

Arguments after "--" are given to the input script in the global `arg` table.

## Bang functions

### Accumulations

Bang can accumulate names (rules, targets, ...) in a list
that can later be used to define other rules or build statements.

A standard way to do this in Lua would use a Lua table and `table.concat` or the `list[#list+1]` pattern.
Bang provides a simple function to simplify this usage:

``` lua
my_list = {}
-- ...
acc(my_list) "item1"
acc(my_list) {"item2", "item3"}
--...
my_list -- contains {"item1", "item2", "item3"}
```

### Case expressions

The `case` function provides a switch-like structure to simplify conditional expressions.
`case` is a curried function that takes a value (generally a string) and a table.
It searches for the value in the keys of the table and returns the associated value.
If the key is not found it returns the value associated to the `Nil` key or `nil`.

E.g.:

``` lua
local cflags = {
    case(mode) {
        debug   = "-g -Og",
        release = "-s -O3",
        [Nil]   = Nil,  -- equivalent to [Nil] = {}
    }
}
```

**Note**: `Nil` is a special value that can be used to represent nothing (no
value) in a list. `Nil` is ignored by bang.

### File listing

The `ls` function lists files in a directory.
It returns a list of filenames,
with the metatable of [LuaX F lists](https://github.com/CDSoft/luax/blob/master/doc/F.md).

- `ls "path"`: list of file names in `path`
- `ls "path/*.c"`: list of file names matching the "`*.c`" pattern in `path`
- `ls "path/**"`: recursive list of file names in `path`
- `ls "path/**.c"`: recursive list of file names matching the "`*.c`" pattern in `path`

E.g.:

``` lua
ls "doc/*.md"
: foreach(function(doc)
    build (doc:chext".pdf") { "md_to_pdf", doc }
end)
-- where md_to_pdf is a rule to convert Markdown files to PDF
```

### Dynamic file creation

The `file` function creates new files.
It returns a callable object to add text to a file (note that the `write` method is deprecated).
The file is actually written when bang exits successfully.

``` lua
file "name" "content"
```

The file can be generated incrementally by calling the file object several times:

``` lua
f = file "name"
-- ...
f "Line 1\n"
-- ...
f "Line 2\n"
-- ...
```

### Pipes

It is common in Makefiles to write commands with pipes.
But pipes can be error prone since only the failure of the last process is captured by default.
A simple solution (for Makefiles or Ninja files) is to chain several rules.

The `pipe` function takes a list of rules and returns a function that applies all the rules,
in the order of the list. This function takes two parameters: the output and the inputs of the pipe.

Intermediate outputs are stored in `$builddir/tmp`
(this directory can be changed by adding a `builddir` attribute to the rule list).
If a rule name contains a dot, its « extension » is used to name intermediate outputs.

E.g.:

``` lua
rule "ypp.md"     { command = "ypp $in -o $out" }
rule "panda.html" { command = "panda $in -o $out", implicit_in = "foo.css" }

local ypp_then_panda = pipe { "ypp.md", "panda.md" }

ypp_then_panda "$builddir/doc/mydoc.html" "doc/mydoc.md"
```

is equivalent to:

``` lua
build "$builddir/tmp/doc/mydoc.md" { "ypp.md", "doc/mydoc.md" }
build "$builddir/doc/mydoc.html"   { "panda.html", "$builddir/tmp/doc/mydoc.md" }
```

Since `rule` returns the name of the rule, this can also be written as:

``` lua
local ypp_then_panda = pipe {
    rule "ypp.md"     { command = "ypp $in -o $out" },
    rule "panda.html" { command = "panda $in -o $out", implicit_in = "foo.css" },
}
```

The input list can contain variable definitions. These variables are added to
**all** build statements, except for `implicit_in` and `implicit_out` that are
added respectively to the first and last build statements only.

e.g.:

``` lua
ypp_then_panda "out.html" { "in.md",
    implicit_in = "foo.in",
    implicit_out = "foo.out",
    other_var = "42",
}
```

is equivalent to:

``` lua
build "$builddir/tmp/doc/out-1.md" { "ypp.md", "doc/in.md",
    implicit_in = "foo.in",
    other_var = "42",
}
build "out.html" { "panda.html", "$builddir/tmp/doc/out-1.md",
    implicit_out = "foo.out",
    other_var = "42",
}
```

### Clean

Bang can generate targets to clean the generated files.
The `clean` function takes a directory name that shall be deleted by `ninja clean`.

``` lua
clean "$builddir"   -- `ninja clean` cleans $builddir
clean "tmp/foo"     -- `ninja clean` cleans tmp/foo
```

`clean` defines the target `clean` (run by `ninja clean`)
and a line in the help message (see `ninja help`).

In the same vein, `clean.mrproper` takes directories to clean with `ninja mrproper`.

### Install

Bang can generate targets to install files outside the build directories.
The `install` function adds targets to be installed with `ninja install`

The default installation prefix can be set by `install.prefix`:

``` lua
install.prefix "$$HOME/foo/bar"     -- `ninja install` installs to ~/foo/bar
```

The default prefix in `~/.local`.

It can be overridden by the `PREFIX` environment variable when calling Ninja. E.g.:

``` bash
$ PREFIX=~/bar/foo ninja install
```

Artifacts are added to the list of files to be installed by the function `install`.
This function takes the name of the destination directory, relative to the prefix and the file to be installed.

``` lua
install "bin" "$builddir/bang" -- installs bang to $PREFIX/bin/
```

`install` defines the target `install` (run by `ninja install`)
and a line in the help message (see `ninja help`).

### Help

Bang can generate an help message (stored in a file next to the Ninja file) displayed by `ninja help`.

The help message is composed of three parts:

- a description of the Ninja file
- a list of targets with their descriptions
- an epilogue

The description and epilogue are defined by the `help.description` and `help.epilog` (or `help.epilogue`) functions.
Targets can be added by the `help` function. It takes the name of a target and its description.

``` lua
help.description "A super useful Ninja file"
help.epilog "See https://github.com/cdsoft/bang"
-- ...
help "compile" "Compile every thing"
-- ...
```

> [!NOTE]
> the `clean` and `install` target are automatically documented
> by the `clean` and `install` functions.

### Generator

Bang generates a generator rule to update the Ninja file when the build description changes.
This behaviour can be customized or disabled with the `generator` function:

- `generator(true)`: bang adds a generator rule at the end of the ninja file (default behaviour)
- `generator(false)`: bang does not add a generator rule
- `generator(t)`: if `t` is a table, bang adds a generator rule with the additional variables defined in `t`

The generator rule runs bang with the same options than the initial bang command.

E.g.:

``` lua
generator {
    implicit_in = { "foo", "bar" },
}
```

In this example, the generator statement will be executed if the Lua script has
changed as well as `foo` and `bar`.

## Higher level build modules

### C compilers

The module `C` creates C compilation objects.
This module is available as a `build` function metamethod.

The module itself is a default compiler that should works on most Linux and MacOS systems
and uses `cc`.

A new compiler can be created by calling the `new` method of an existing compiler with a new name
and changing some options. E.g.:

``` lua
local my_compiler = build.C:new "my_compiler"   -- creates a new C compiler named "my_compiler"
    : set "cc" "gcc"                            -- compiler command
    : add "cflags" { "-O2", "-Iinclude" }       -- compilation flags
```

A compiler has two methods to modify options:

- `set` changes the value of an option
- `add` adds values to the current value of an option
- `insert` adds values before the current value of an option

| Option        | Description                               | Default value                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `builddir`    | Build dir for temporary files             | `"$builddir"`                     |
| `cc`          | Compilation command                       | `"cc"`                            |
| `cflags`      | Compilation options                       | `{"-c", "-MD -MF $depfile"}`      |
| `cargs`       | Input and output                          | `"$in -o $out"`                   |
| `depfile`     | Dependency file name                      | `"$out.d"`                        |
| `cvalid`      | Validation rule                           | `{}`                              |
| `ar`          | Archive command (static libraries)        | `"ar"`                            |
| `aflags`      | Archive flags                             | `"-crs"`                          |
| `aargs`       | Inputs anf output                         | `"$in -o $out"`                   |
| `so`          | Link command (dynamic libraries)          | `"cc"`                            |
| `soflags`     | Link options                              | `"-shared"`                       |
| `soargs`      | Inputs and output                         | `"$in -o $out"`                   |
| `ld`          | Link command (executables)                | `"cc"`                            |
| `ldflags`     | Link options                              | `{}`                              |
| `ldargs`      | Inputs and output                         | `"$in -o $out"`                   |
| `c_exts`      | List of C source extensions               | `{ ".c" }`                        |
| `o_ext`       | Object file extension                     | `".o"`                            |
| `a_ext`       | Archive file extension                    | `".a"`                            |
| `so_ext`      | Dynamic library file extension            | `".so"`, `".dylib"` or "`.dll`"   |
| `exe_ext`     | Executable file extension                 | `""` or `".exe"`                  |
| `implicit_in` | Implicit inputs (e.g. custom compiler)    | `Nil`                             |

A compiler can compile a single C source as well as complete libraries and executables.
Inputs of libraries or executables can be C sources
(which will be compiled in a subdirectory of `builddir`)
or other static libraries.

Examples:

``` lua
-- Compilation of a single source file
local obj_file = my_compiler:compile "$builddir/file.o" "file.c"

-- Creation of a static library
local lib_a = my_compiler:static_lib "$builddir/lib.a" {
    obj_file,       -- already compiled
    ls "lib/*.c",   -- compile and archive all sources in the lib directory
}

-- Creation of a dynamic library
local lib_so = my_compiler:dynamic_lib "$builddir/lib.so" {
    lib_a,
    ls "dynlib/*.c",
}

-- Creation of an executable file
local exe = my_compiler:executable "$builddir/file.exe" {
    lib_a,
    "src/main.c",
}

-- Same with an all-in-one statement
local exe = my_compiler:executable "$builddir/file.exe" {
    "file.c",
    ls "lib/*.c",
    "src/main.c",
}

-- The `__call` metamethod is a shortcut to the `executable` method
local exe = my_compiler "$builddir/file.exe" {
    "file.c",
    ls "lib/*.c",
    "src/main.c",
}
```

The `C` module predefines some C and C++ compilers (cc, gcc, clang and zig).
These compilers are also available as `build` metamethods.

| Compiler                              | Language  | Compiler  | Target                |

### LuaX compilers

The module `luax` creates LuaX compilation objects.
This module is available as a `build` function metamethod.

The module itself is a default compiler that generates a Lua script executable by `luax`.

A new compiler can be created by calling the `new` method of an existing compiler with a new name
and changing some options. E.g.:

``` lua
local luaxq = build.luax:new "luax-q"   -- creates a new LuaX compiler named "luax-q"
    : add "flags" "-q"                  -- add some compilation flags
```

A compiler has two methods to modify options:

- `set` changes the value of an option
- `add` adds values to the current value of an option
- `insert` adds values before the current value of an option

The module also provides the methods `set_global`, `add_global` and `insert_global` to add flags to all builtin LuaX compilers.

| Option        | Description                               | Default value                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `luax`        | LuaX binary to use to compile scripts     | `"luax"`                          |
| `target`      | Name of the target[^targets]              | `"luax"`                          |
| `flags`       | Compilation options                       | `{}`                              |
| `implicit_in` | Implicit inputs (e.g. custom compiler)    | `Nil`                             |

[^targets]: The available LuaX targets can be listed with `luax compile -t list`.

Examples:

``` lua
-- make all LuaX compiler silent
build.luax.add_global "flags" "-q"

-- Compile hello.lua and some libs to a linux-x86_64-musl executable
build.luax["linux-x86_64-musl"] "hello" { "hello.lua", "lib1.lua", "lib2.lua" }
```

### Builders

The `build` function has methods to create new builder objects
(note that these methods are also available in the "builders" module).

The `build` metamethods contain some predefined builders:

| Builder                   | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

[^blockdiag]: Other Blockdiag renderers are: `activity`, `network`, `packet`, `rack` and `sequence`.

A new builder can be created by calling the `new` method of an existing builder with a new name
and changing some options. E.g.:

``` lua
local tac = build.cat:new "tac"   -- new builder "tac" based on "cat"
    : set "cmd" "tac"
```

The `new` method of the `build` function can also be used to create a new builder from scratch:

``` lua
local tac = build.new "tac"   -- new builder "tac"
    : set "cmd" "tac"
    : set "args" "$in > $out"
```

A builder has two methods to modify options:

- `set` changes the value of an option
- `add` adds values to the current value of an option
- `insert` adds values before the current value of an option

| Option        | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `cmd`         | Command to execute                    |
| `flags`       | Command options                       |
| `args`        | Input and output                      |
| `depfile`     | Dependency file name                  |

Other options are added to the rule definition (note that `name` can not be used as a rule variable).

Examples:

``` lua
-- preprocess Markdown files with ypp
-- and convert them to a single HTML file with pandoc
build.pandoc "$builddir/output.html" {
    build.ypp "$builddir/output.md" { "input1.md", "input2.md" }
}
```

`build` also provides some helper functions to format arguments:

| Function                          | Description                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build.ypp_var`                   | Build ypp arguments to pass values from an object to ypp variables (serialized Lua object).   |
| `build.ypp_vars`                  | Build ypp arguments to pass values from a table to ypp variables (one variable per field).    |

Examples:

``` lua
build.ypp : add "flags" {
    -- call ypp with « -e 'VARNAME=(\"serialized object\"):read()' »
    build.ypp_var "VARNAME" { VERSION="0.0", NAME="example" },
    -- call ypp with « -e 'VERSION="0.0"' -e 'NAME="example" »
    build.ypp_vars { VERSION="0.0", NAME="example" },
}
```

### Archivers

The `archivers` module define rules to archive files.
These archivers are also available as `build` metamethods.

Currently only [tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) archives are supported.

#### Tar archives

`build.tar` creates a tar archive from a directory which must be populated by previous build statements.
It takes three arguments:

- `base`: base directory where tar will start archiving files
- `name` (optional): name of the subdirectory (in `base`) that will actually be archived.
  If `name` is not defined, all files and directories below `base` will be archived.
- `transform` (optional): [`sed`]() expression(s) used to transform file names in the archive.

The tar rule uses the `--auto-compress` option to determine the compression program to use according to the archive name.

Example:

``` lua
-- archive $builddir/release/foo in $builddir/foo.tar.gz
build.tar "$builddir/foo.tar.gz" {
    base = "$builddir/release",
    name = "foo",
}
```
