Bang example
============

This example shows how to:

- discover source files actually present in the repository
- detect the host OS to infer compilation options
- compile Lua
- install Lua

[`build.lua`](build.lua) contains Lua code that produces [`build.ninja`](build.ninja)
(or just run [`build.sh`](build.sh) to recompile bang and this example).

For more information, just look at the sources...
